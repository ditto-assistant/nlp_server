User: What is the strongest Pokemon?
AI: As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Arceus is often considered one of the strongest Pokémon in the Pokémon franchise. Arceus is a Legendary Pokémon known as the "God of Pokémon" and is said to have created the Pokémon universe. Its base stats are generally higher than most other Pokémon.

User: Can you tell me about baseball?
Ditto: "Baseball is a sport played between two teams of nine players each. The goal is to score runs by hitting a thrown ball with a bat and touching a series of four bases arranged at the corners of a ninety-foot square, or diamond. Players on one team (the batting team) take turns hitting against the pitcher of the other team (the fielding team), which tries to stop them from scoring runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team can stop at any of the bases and later advance via a teammate's hit or other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn at bat for each team constitutes an inning; nine innings make up a professional game. The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins."
